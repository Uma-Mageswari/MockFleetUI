# React Dashboard

A React-based mock UI for a fleet management system using Material-UI and TypeScript. 

## Features

- **Material-UI (MUI)** for building responsive and modern UI components
- **TypeScript** for static type checking
- **React Hooks & Functional Components** for cleaner code and better performance
- **Charting**: Includes integration with `@mui/x-charts` for visualizing data
- **ESLint** with TypeScript for consistent coding style
- **Pre-configured Husky & lint-staged** for pre-commit linting
- **GitHub Pages Deployment** for easy hosting and previewing
- **Responsive Layout** designed with Material-UI's Grid and Flexbox

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have `Node.js` and `npm` installed. You can check your installed versions using:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Installation

Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-dashboard.git
cd react-dashboard
```

### Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

To start the development server and view the project locally, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the application and open it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Linting

To run the linter and check for issues:

```bash
npm run lint
```

To automatically fix linting issues:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

### Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

This will run the tests once. To watch the tests for changes, simply run:

```bash
npm test -- --watchAll=true
```

### Build for Production

To create a production-ready build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build/` directory with optimized files ready for deployment.

### Deployment to GitHub Pages

To deploy the app to GitHub Pages:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Make sure that your repository is already linked to GitHub Pages and you have the correct settings in place (i.e., your `homepage` field in `package.json`).

### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses Husky and lint-staged to automatically run ESLint on staged `.tsx` files before committing. If you modify any `.tsx` file, the linter will automatically run before commit.
